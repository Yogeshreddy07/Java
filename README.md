# â˜• My Java & DSA Learning Journey

Hey! I'm **Yogesh**, and this is where I document my daily coding practice. Every day, I solve problems, learn new concepts, and get one step closer to becoming a better programmer.

**Mission:** Build solid Java fundamentals and crush those coding interviews! ðŸŽ¯



##  Why I Code Daily

I'm committed to coding **every single day** because:

- Small daily efforts compound into big results
- Consistency builds muscle memory for problem-solving
- Tracking progress keeps me motivated
- Future me will thank present me

*"A year from now, you'll wish you had started today."*
